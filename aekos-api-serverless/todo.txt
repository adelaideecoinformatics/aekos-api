- add HATEOAS headers
 - for CSV
 - for JSON
 - is it ok to use a POST (for species,traits,etc) with query string (for paging) so we can generate the <link>s? Should we store continutation tokens on the server (probably not)?
- add download option for CSVs
- make getSpeciesByTrait perform and return the correct result
- remove verbs from resources
- add 400 and 500 responses to all resources
