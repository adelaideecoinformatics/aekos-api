- add HATEOAS headers
 - for CSV
 - for JSON
 - is it ok to use a POST (for species,traits,etc) with query string (for paging) so we can generate the <link>s? Should we store continutation tokens on the server (probably not)?
- add download option for CSVs
- make getSpeciesByTrait perform and return the correct result
- remove verbs from resources (v2 change)
- add 400 and 500 responses to all resources
- add status code to 4/500 response objects
- return an appropriate HTTP status when a 'page out of bounds' occurs
- figure out why the domain-manager doesn't add the base path mapping
- move all model stuff out of serverless.yml into the model-schemas.yml file. Have two sections: fragments and models
- move schemas into relevant handler function files, add tests to assert conformance
- create a health check rig that calls every endpoint and verifies the responses match the schema
