    traitDataVsSpeciesData: >
      This resource differs from 'speciesData*' in that it will potentially return fewer records.
      'speciesData*' will return all species records whereas this resource will only return records
      that have either a) any traits, if no trait filter is applied, or b) the specified traits if
      a filter is applied. You'll never get records with no traits from this resource.
    noChangesSinceV1: No changes since version 1, just keeping version numbers synchronised.
